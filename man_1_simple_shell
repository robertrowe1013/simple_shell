.TH VRSHELL 1 "09 April 2020" "version 1.0" "vrshell manpage"
.SH NAME
vrshell - a simple linux shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./vrsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vrshell
is a command language interpreter that executes commands from the standard
input.
.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument from input is the command to be executed followed by
any parameters taken in the by the command.
.B Vrshell
executes the command then exits. The exit status is the exit status of the last
command executed. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple
command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are
taken.
.PP
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.
.B Vrshell
searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable
file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error
message and returns an exit status of 127.
.PP
If the search is successful, the shell executes the named program in a separate
execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining
arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the
environment. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.
.SH EXIT STATUS
For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status
has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero:
exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal
signal N, vrshell uses the value of 128+N as the exit status.
.PP
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it
returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable,
the return status is 126.
.B Vrshell
itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax
error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.
.SH VRSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
.B exit
[n]
.PP
Cause the shell to exit with a status of n. If n is omitted, the exit status is
that of the last command executed.
